## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Non-Custodial**: The protocol doesn't hold actual funds - escrow is tracked for settlement
2. **7-Day Window**: Default escrow hold period (configurable per order)
3. **Payment Methods**: Support for Lightning, Bitcoin, Stripe, PayPal, bank transfer
4. **Ownership Validation**: All mutations check buyer/vendor ownership
5. **State Machine**: Invalid transitions throw errors
6. **Audit Trail**: All status changes logged in `order_status_log`

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ Order created with status `payment_pending`  
✅ Payment creates escrow in `held` status  
✅ Order progresses through states sequentially  
✅ Escrow released when order `completed`  
✅ Escrow refunded when order `cancelled`  
✅ History shows all status transitions  
✅ Unauthorized access blocked with 403
